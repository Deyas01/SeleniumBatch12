//Types of variables;
		// There are 3 types of variables local, instance and static (inside method

		Class Vars{
			int age=10; //instance variable
			static double weight=25.5; //static

			void method() {
				String name="Moreed"; // local variable

			}
		}
	//local variables:
//if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other break of code it is called local variable.
//Instance variables:
// if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside of the class then it is called an instance variable
		//Static variable:
		//// if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside of the class
		and it has static keyword wiht it then
		it is called a static variable.
When to use which type of variable:
Local variables:
	Local variables should always be prefereed over instance and static variables
	Why because they occoupy the computers' memory for very, very short amount of time
	as soon as their pupose is served Java destroys them.
	Pros:
		save memory
		Cons:
	Instance Variable:
	When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the info is expected to be different from objicto object
	we should go wiht instance variable
	Pros:
		Accessible inall the methods of a class
		Cons:
			Occupy th ecomputer; memory for longer than local variables.

	Static variables:
		When we know that infor will stay same for all the objects of a class we should create
		a static variable for that
		Prose:
			Single memory location for all objects of aclass
			Cons:
				Lonber in the memory
				can hold only one value at a time.

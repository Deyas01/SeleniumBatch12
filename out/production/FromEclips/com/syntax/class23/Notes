Class 23:

 we overload the constructors
    we can overload the static methods as well
    we can overload the main method as well

Rules for static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly
instance methods can access instance as well static fields directly
Break till 11:50
Method overriding:
    1)Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent class and
    in the child class
    2) we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two
    classes
    3) we can't override the private methods because they don't participate in
    inheritance
    4)we can't override the constructors because they don't participate in
          inheritance

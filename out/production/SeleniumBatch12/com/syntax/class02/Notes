Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a wevelements
e.g. buttons, text boxes, checkboxex, links etc.

HTML = HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object model. It is the browder's internal view of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or Dev toos
Doucment --> can be stored any doucuments such as pdf, excel...
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of an wevelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinktext
- Classname

- HTML Scripting Meaning:
Purple -- tags || button, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue --> attribute value ||

Why do we need many locators?
- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
ex, link and partialLinktext are only used for links

"a" tat is also called an anchor tag

If 2 or more elements have the same attributes and attribute valuses,
Selenium will only intract with the first element it locater
